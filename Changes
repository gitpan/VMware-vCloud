Revision history for VMware::vCloud

2.01     2011/09/30

  This is a major change in philosophy. Previously this module emulated the API
  in the name of method and returned data structures.

  This does not match most conceptual and desired usage for automation. People
  do not "think" in a collection of REST API calls. They think in actions like
  "deploy a VM."

  Consequently I have moved the direct API implementation to 
  VMware::API::vCloud. It offers an unadulterated pure-perl based view of the
  API and its transactions.

  In VMware::vCloud, I am going to try and present a more human friendly view.

  Added:
      lib/VMware/API/vCloud.pm - Raw API calls and returns.

  Fixed:
      Session ID is now handled via HTTP header, not cookies. This matches the published API docs.

  Added:
	examples/list-vms.pl - List all vApps and their VMs

  Improved:
    Added POD to the examples: get_org.pl, login.pl
    Fixed double "v" on new Version in POD

1.600.07 2011/07/29

  Added:    
    vdc_get() - List the contents of a Virtual Datacenter
    vapp_get() - List the contents of a vApp

  Fixed:
    Moved to multidigit CPAN-compatible version to work around single-digit subversion numbers.

  Added:
    catalog_get() - List a catalogs contents

  NB: Release created and submitted from the air on cross-country flight. :)
