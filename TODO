TODO!

These items are goals and plans for the future for this module. They recognize
deficiencies and inefficiencies in the current module:

- Add all internal methods
- Improve documentation on return values on all methods
- Verify that all methods are complete
- Better handling of method handles
- Better handling of errors
- Handle all "singleton" return conditions to force arrays when appropriate
