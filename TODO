TODO!

These items are goals and plans for the future for this module. They recognize
deficiencies and inefficiencies in the current module:

- Move away from hard-coded v1.0 of API

- Support all methods. :)

- Unified LWP handling to be able to dump transactions at debug and error levels
- Better handling of errors
- Improve documentation on return values on all methods
- Verify that all methods are complete
- Handle all "singleton" return conditions to force arrays when appropriate
